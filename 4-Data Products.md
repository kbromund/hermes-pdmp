# 4 Data Products

## 4.1 Data Level Definitions
### 4.1.1 NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Defined Levels
In anticipation of the proposed July 2021 revision of the SMD Scientific Information Policy, HERMES will utilize Data Level Definitions given below in Table 4-1.

Table 4-1. NASA SMD Data Level Definitions
|Data Level|Description|
|-|-|
|0|Unprocessed instrument and payload data at full resolution, with any and all communications artifacts (e.g., synchronization frames, communications headers, duplicate data) removed. This level of data may only be available upon request.|
|1|Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced, and annotated with ancillary information. This level of data will be in a standard format that is accessible.|
|2|Data that has been processed to remove instrument or sensor effects.|
|3|Data that has been mapped on to a uniform space-time grid, resampled, or combined to produce a set of data with greater completeness and consistency.|
|4|Products delivered as part of a Mission derived from data. This could include model outputs, analysis of results, catalogs, or databases derived from Mission data.|

## 4.1.2 HERMES Project Defined Data Levels
Additionally, HERMES will produce two levels of data not incorporated in the SMD Data Level hierarchy.

Quicklook (QL) data products will be produced and released through the SDC within 1 day of delivery of telemetry by the HOSC to the MOC. These products will be similar in nature to data products at Levels 2 and 3, but quality is not validated prior to release, algorithms for production may be simplified, and the data products do not benefit from calibration updates employed in production for Levels 2 and 3. QL data are useful for identification and evaluation of changes in instrument performance. They are suitable for identification of events or regions encountered by Gateway and therefore will be valuable as an early guide for scientific research. QL data are not approved by the HERMES Project for publication. Publications should rely on Level-2 and Level-3 data products which are validated by the instrument teams within one month of receipt of telemetry and supersede any information provided in QL files.

Auxiliary data include calibration data and other parameters that the HERMES Project utilizes in production of data at Levels 2 and 3. They can be used for independent validation of HERMES data products.

Table 4-2. HERMES Project Data Definitions
| Data Level | Description |
|-|-|
|Quicklook (QL)|Processed but unvalidated data products that can be used to evaluate instrument performance and as an early guide for research. These may be similar to products at Level 2 or Level 3. However, they do not utilize improvements to calibrations developed for Levels 2 and 3 data, and may utilize simplified production algorithms. The HERMES Project does not approve the use of Quicklook data for scientific publication.|
|Auxiliary (Aux)| Calibration factors and other instrument-related factors required for production of Level-2 and Level-3 data from Level 1 data.|

### 4.1.3 Schedule for Release of Data
An initial release of data to the public will occur as soon as is practical for data at Levels 1 and 2, and not later than 6 months after completion of commissioning. Subsequent releases will be monthly. Once data have been delivered by the HOSC to the MOC, the Level-1 and Quicklook data products will be updated within one day. Data at Level 3 will be updated monthly, once algorithms have been developed, verified, and validated. Level-4 data products will be added to the SDC as they become available. All data will be accessible by the public without restriction via the SDC interface, with the exception of Level-0 data. It is not anticipated that users will have need of Level-0 data. Level-0 data will be made available upon request.

Table 4-3. Data Release Schedule. Following Level-0 receipt by the SOC from the  MOC.
| Data Level | Public Release |
|-|-|
|0|Upon Request|
|1|Daily|
|2|Monthly|
|3|Monthly|
|4|Upon Receipt|
|Quicklook|Daily|
|Auxiliary|Monthly|

## 4.2 Data Formats
The SDC will produce and distribute data in the Common Data Format (CDF) utilized by NASAâ€™s Space Physics Data Facility for archival of Heliophysics data.
